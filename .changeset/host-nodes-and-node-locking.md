Host nodes (live code-component embeds) + two-tier node locking — two orthogonal, universal primitives so an authored page can carry a live, host-owned functional region (checkout, search, cart, a data grid) pinned in place. Design authority: `docs/host-nodes-and-node-locking.md`.

- **Node locking** — new `NodeBase.locked?: "host" | "author"` (presence encodes locked; the value encodes the owner). The editing spine refuses `remove`/`move`/reparent on any locked node, `duplicate` yields an unlocked copy, and a new tier-blind `setLocked(id, owner)` primitive is undoable. The Inspector's Settings tab gains a Lock row (an author toggle, or a read-only "Locked by host" indicator with no unlock — only the host clears a host lock); the Navigator shows an owner-aware lock/shield glyph. Generalizes the outlet/root protection; no projection reads `locked`.

- **Host nodes** — new `HostNode { kind: "host"; component; props }` in the node union (+ a `host()` kit helper). `toHtml` projects an **empty** `<div data-sui-host="…" data-sui-host-props="…">` mount point — never live framework code, preserving the framework-neutral projection promise — into which a host mounts its real component (client or SSR), the same trust model as behavior-marker hydration and `rawHtml`. Every traversal (`stampTree`/`walk`/`flattenSymbols`/`resolveTree`) passes a host node through untouched.

- **`@wizeworks/silicaui-behaviors`** — new optional `mountHostNodes(registry, root?)` helper, the client-side companion to the mount points (symmetric with `hydrate()`); host components stay host-owned.

- **Builder** — `BuilderHost` gains `hostComponents()` (Insert-palette entries, `pinned` inserts host-locked) and `renderHostNode()` (live canvas preview, with a labeled placeholder fallback), plus `HostComponentDef`/`HostPropDef`/`HostRenderCtx`. The engine treats a host node as a selectable **leaf** — drop-*beside*, never drop-*into* — and `setProp` writes host props. The Inspector renders a Host panel from the component's declared props.
