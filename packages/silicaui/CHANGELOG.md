### Minor Changes

- 273c7f8: Give the system a coherent z-scale, and one shared field-affordance geometry.

  **z-scale.** Every globally-stacked surface now reads a token instead of a
  locally-chosen literal: `--z-drawer` (40), `--z-dialog` (50), `--z-lightbox`
  (60), `--z-popover` (70), `--z-tooltip` (80), `--z-toast` (90). The ordering rule
  is that a transient surface outranks anything it can be opened from.

  This fixes a real bug: every popover-class surface (`.dropdown`, `.popover`,
  `.select-popup`, `.navigation-menu`, `.preview-card`, the calendar popup) sat at
  `z-index: 50` while `.dialog` sat at `51`, so **any picker opened inside a modal
  rendered underneath it**. No component prop could fix it — a child can't
  out-stack its own parent's level — so apps were patching it in global CSS.

  Note the changed defaults if you have hand-tuned z-indexes against the old
  values: popovers moved `50 → 70`, tooltips `50 → 80`, and toasts `9999 → 90`.
  Each token is overridable, so `:root { --z-toast: 9999 }` restores the old top.

  **Field affordances.** The native `<select>` caret, the listbox trigger's
  chevron, and the Combobox / MultiSelect clear + open buttons were three
  independent implementations that had drifted apart — a solid gradient wedge at
  one trailing inset, a stroked SVG chevron at another, a third inside a round
  button at a third — so a Select and a Combobox stacked in one form showed
  visibly different marks at visibly different positions. They now derive from a
  single contract (`lib/field-affordance.js`): same mark, same ink, same trailing
  inset, same rotation-on-open.

  The most visible change is the native `<select>`, which now draws a **stroked**
  chevron matching the SVG one rather than a solid wedge. It's still painted with
  gradients — a `<select>` can carry neither a child nor a reliable
  pseudo-element, and an SVG data-URI can't resolve a CSS var — so the mark still
  follows the theme.

### Minor Changes

- 4d96f1c: ToggleGroup gains `size` and `color` props

  The CSS already carried a size vocabulary (`toggle-group-xs|sm|lg`, `md` default)
  and a colored active pill, but the React wrapper exposed neither — you had to hand-write
  the class. It now takes `size` (`xs | sm | md | lg`) and `color`, matching Button's prop shape.

  The colored pill is also no longer limited to three hard-coded roles: `toggleGroup()` now
  takes the plugin's `colors` list and emits a class per registered color, so any custom color
  works. Colors apply orthogonally — the color class only sets `--toggle-group-pill-*`, which
  the base `[data-pressed]` rule reads.

### Minor Changes

- 065d97b: Data-resolution honesty + a logo-capable brand mark + canvas binding resolution — three orthogonal fixes closing the gap between what the data layer promised and what it did. Design authority: `docs/data-resolution-and-brand-mark.md`.

  - **Resolution honesty (`@wizeworks/silicaui-html`)** — `ResolveHost`'s hooks now return `Resolved | undefined` (and `readonly unknown[] | undefined`), where a bare `undefined` means **"I don't know this ref"** and `{ value: undefined }` keeps its old meaning, **"I know it and it's empty"**. Those were previously the same value, so the walk _couldn't_ tell them apart and blanked the node either way. An unknown ref now **keeps the node's authored content** (marker included, so a re-resolve or a downstream runtime still sees the bind), never drops it, and reports a structured `ResolveDiagnostic` via the new optional `ResolveHost.onDiagnostic`. `omitWhenEmpty` deliberately does **not** apply to an unknown ref — "legitimately empty, render nothing" is a claim only a host that knows the ref can make. The core stays pure: no `console`, no `NODE_ENV` sniffing — loudness is the consumer's call. Widening the return type is source-compatible: an existing host's narrower return still typechecks and behaves exactly as before.

  - **Canvas resolution (`@wizeworks/silicaui-builder`)** — the canvas resolves bindings through the same `resolveTree` primitive `toHtml` uses, via a new `ResolveOptions.editing`. `editing` is a **destruction policy, not a second resolver**: same walker, same hooks, same refs, diverging only where production's answer is "show nothing" — which an editor can't render, because a dropped node can't be selected, inspected, or un-bound. So `visible:false` (and `omitWhenEmpty` at zero items) render **ghosted** and report `code: "hidden"`; unknown refs render their authored content wearing a warning outline plus a `data-sui-unresolved` hook. A **Data on/off toggle** (default on, shown only when the host resolves anything) flips back to the authored placeholder — which is what ships when data is absent, so it must stay visible and editable. Text showing **resolved** data is no longer `contentEditable` (committing it would overwrite the authored placeholder with host data); an unknown ref still shows authored text, so it stays editable. v1 resolves `value`/`html` binds only — a collection keeps its authored template unexpanded _and unresolved_, because cloning children clones their ids (which selection and React keys depend on), and resolving a nested field with no item in scope would blank the very placeholder being laid out.

  - **Brand mark (`@wizeworks/silicaui`, `@wizeworks/silicaui-react`, `@wizeworks/silicaui-html`)** — `Wordmark` can hold a logo. It was a text-only atom while its own CSS and React wrapper both already assumed a mark, so "put the logo in the wordmark" was impossible by construction. It's now a container with `src`/`alt`/`href` props (nesting an `Image`/`Icon` child remains the richer path and wins when present; `href` lowers the mark to an `<a>`, same sugar as `Button`). `alt` defaults to `""` — decorative, since the name renders beside it. The CSS mark rule generalizes from `& svg { width: 1.15em }` to `& :is(svg, img)` height-locked with **width auto**, so a non-square logo is no longer squashed to a square (square marks are unaffected). **Text-only Wordmark markup is byte-identical to before.**

  - **`ComponentDef.primary` (`@wizeworks/silicaui-html`)** — a component now declares which prop a bare `value` bind fills. This replaces `resolve.ts`'s hardcoded `Image`/`Avatar` name-list and its `"src" in props` sniff outright: the name-list meant every new bindable component needed a resolver edit, and the sniff was about to write a bound site **name** into a Wordmark's **logo URL**. `Image`/`Avatar` declare `primary: "src"`; `Wordmark` declares `primary: "text"`. Absent a declaration the old `label` → `text` fallback applies. Same coupling `ComponentDef.container` was introduced to kill.

  - **Host adapters extend, never re-declare** — `BuilderHost` and `EmailBuilderHost` both carried duplicate copies of the resolver hooks, so the widened signature didn't propagate and both Inspectors read `.value` off a possibly-`undefined` with the compiler silent. They now `extends ResolveHost` / `EmailResolveHost`. The builder's React entry also exports the `Editor` type (what `useEditor()` returns — a host couldn't name it), and `Canvas.isEmptyContainer` now asks a component's **expansion** rather than its authored children, so a prop-populated container is no longer painted over with an "empty — drop something here" placeholder.

### Minor Changes

- d0a6ca6: `Field` and `FieldStatus` now support a `floating` prop that takes the status panel out of flow (`position: absolute`, anchored under the field) so it never pushes sibling fields up or down as it appears, changes, or disappears — it overlays whatever's below instead. Off by default.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 3893c74: Toast now supports a clickable action button. `useToast().add()` accepts `actionProps` (forwarded to Base UI's `Toast.Action`, rendered as a `<button>`) — commonly paired with `timeout: 0` so the toast doesn't auto-dismiss before the user can act: `toast.add({ title: "New version available", actionProps: { children: "Refresh", onClick: () => location.reload() }, timeout: 0 })`. Adds a `.toast-action` style (an outlined pill reading `currentColor`/`--toast-fg`, so it stays legible across every `data-type` and in dark mode) positioned between the toast content and the close button.

### Minor Changes

- 970bb4b: Add assignable element animations: `sui-animate-*` (on load), `sui-reveal-*` (on scroll), and `sui-hover-*` presets in `silicaui`, plus `sui-duration-*`/`sui-delay-*` modifiers — all reduced-motion aware. `silicaui-behaviors` gains a `reveal` handler (IntersectionObserver-driven, mirrors `counter`) for the scroll trigger, matched by a new `reveal` `BehaviorType` in `silicaui-html`. The site builder's Inspector (`silicaui-builder`) gets a new Animate section (Trigger/Preset/Speed/Delay) for assigning these to any element; the edit canvas shows the final state while editing, and scroll-triggered reveals actually play in Preview and the published site.

  `silicaui-mcp`'s catalog is regenerated to include the new classes and behavior. Along the way, fixed a latent bug in its generator-arg detection that silently produced wrong class names for any `(prefix)`-only component (`card`, `skeleton`, and now `animations`).

### Minor Changes

- e8bd507: Toolbar: add `size` ("sm"/"md"/"lg"), `variant` ("muted"), `dividers` ("top"/"bottom"/"both"), and a `ToolbarCenter` region for start/center/end layouts (e.g. centered tabs with actions on either side).

  Email builder: add a Navigator (layers) panel to the left rail, mirroring the site builder's tree view; text blocks gain a `fontWeight` control and the color palette now exposes the full set of semantic roles (secondary/accent/neutral/info/success/warning/error), not just primary/base.

### Patch Changes

- `ChatMessage` (the convenience wrapper, not the raw `Chat`/`ChatHeader`/`ChatFooter` primitives) now renders name/time _after_ the bubble instead of before it, matching a modern messaging-app read where the message is the point and the timestamp is a quiet trailing detail. The avatar's alignment flips from bottom- to top-anchored (`.chat-image` `align-self: start`) so it lines up with whatever's first in the group — the bubble in `ChatMessage`'s new order, or a `ChatHeader` name/time row for anyone composing the primitives directly (e.g. a Slack-style header-above layout) — instead of hanging toward a short trailing metadata line.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Fix several layout/visibility bugs found while auditing the playground, and add a proper chat typing indicator:

  - **Alert/Toast**: top-align the leading icon and trailing actions/close button (`align-items: flex-start`) instead of centering them against the whole (often multi-line) row. `.alert-close`/`.alert-actions`/`.toast-close` now claim their own trailing space via `margin-inline-start: auto` instead of relying on a sibling `AlertContent` to flex-grow — a dismissible one-liner Alert (bare children, no `AlertContent`) previously left the `×` sitting right next to the text instead of at the row's end.
  - **Collapsible**: new `CollapsibleTrigger` `variant="icon"` — a compact circular disclosure control (sized like `AlertClose`) for placing a second trigger in its own layout slot (e.g. an Alert's trailing actions) while a `variant="default"` trigger elsewhere carries the visible label; both share one `Collapsible`'s open state via context.
  - **Collapse**: renamed its CSS class from `.collapse` to `.details` everywhere (CSS, React, the `-html` macro, the prefix-recognition table, the builder's palette). Tailwind v4 ships a built-in `.collapse { visibility: collapse }` utility (for table row/column collapsing) that silently won over the component's own rule of the same name, making every `Collapse` invisible while it still occupied layout space. The public React names (`Collapse`/`CollapseTitle`/`CollapseContent`) are unchanged.
  - **Carousel**: `className` now applies to both the outer positioning root and the inner scroll strip, not just the strip. Previously a width-constraining class (e.g. `max-w-lg`) shrank the visible strip while the prev/next controls — absolutely positioned against the _root_ — stayed anchored to the full, unconstrained parent width.
  - **MockupPhone**: no component change; documented that content should fill the display (`w-full h-full`), not a fixed size smaller than it.
  - **Chat**: `.chat-layout-messages` now bottom-anchors (`justify-content: flex-end`) so a short conversation sits against the composer instead of pinned to the top with a dead gap below it. Added `ChatTypingIndicator` — three animated dots inside a real `.chat-bubble` (matching avatar/placement of a normal message) — replacing the old plain-text "is typing…" convention.
