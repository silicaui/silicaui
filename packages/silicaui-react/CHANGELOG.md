## 0.23.0

## 0.22.0

## 0.21.0

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- d0a6ca6: `Field` and `FieldStatus` now support a `floating` prop that takes the status panel out of flow (`position: absolute`, anchored under the field) so it never pushes sibling fields up or down as it appears, changes, or disappears — it overlays whatever's below instead. Off by default.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- 3893c74: Toast now supports a clickable action button. `useToast().add()` accepts `actionProps` (forwarded to Base UI's `Toast.Action`, rendered as a `<button>`) — commonly paired with `timeout: 0` so the toast doesn't auto-dismiss before the user can act: `toast.add({ title: "New version available", actionProps: { children: "Refresh", onClick: () => location.reload() }, timeout: 0 })`. Adds a `.toast-action` style (an outlined pill reading `currentColor`/`--toast-fg`, so it stays legible across every `data-type` and in dark mode) positioned between the toast content and the close button.

### Minor Changes

- 8b540c0: Add Google Fonts theming to the site builder. `ThemeEditor`'s body and heading typeface controls are now a searchable picker over ~1900 Google Fonts (previously a 4-option body toggle and a 2-option "Match body"/"Serif" heading toggle) — selecting a font live-loads it in the canvas for preview and records the exact family/weights on the new optional `Theme.fonts` field, so a host can self-host the real files at publish time instead of hotlinking Google's CDN (a real EU privacy liability for published sites).

  New package `@wizeworks/silicaui-fonts` provides `selfHostGoogleFonts()` — a Node-only, publish-time utility a host's backend calls to fetch and self-host the actual font files, given `theme.fonts` from `PublishPayload`.

  Also adds `Combobox`'s `popupProps` (mirroring `Select`) so a portaled Combobox popup can re-stamp `[data-theme]` when opened from inside a scoped theme island.

## 0.15.0

## 0.14.0

### Patch Changes

- aa589af: `buttonClasses`, `badgeClasses`, and `clickableCardClasses` (added in 0.13.0) now actually work from a Server Component. They previously lived inside `button.tsx`/`badge.tsx`/`card.tsx`, part of the bundle `@wizeworks/silicaui-react`'s main entry stamps `"use client"` onto — importing them there handed a Server Component an unusable client reference, not a callable function. They now live in framework-agnostic `lib/` modules (no React dependency) exported from both the main entry and `@wizeworks/silicaui-react/server`, so `import { buttonClasses } from "@wizeworks/silicaui-react/server"` gets a real function.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 386a0c1: `mergeProps` (the merge behind every component's `render` prop) now tolerates a `theirs` of `undefined`, so passing a Server Component's client-component element through `render` degrades gracefully instead of throwing — crossing that boundary serializes the element as a lazy client reference whose `.props` reads as `undefined`. `Validator`/`FloatingLabel`'s direct `children.props` reads get the same treatment.

  Also export `buttonClasses`, `badgeClasses`, and `clickableCardClasses` — the class-string logic behind `Button`, `Badge`, and `ClickableCard`, as standalone functions with no React context dependency. A Server Component can now style a plain element directly (e.g. `<Link className={buttonClasses({ color: "neutral", variant: "ghost" })}>`) instead of needing the client-side `render` composition.

## 0.10.1

## 0.10.0

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- e8bd507: Toolbar: add `size` ("sm"/"md"/"lg"), `variant` ("muted"), `dividers` ("top"/"bottom"/"both"), and a `ToolbarCenter` region for start/center/end layouts (e.g. centered tabs with actions on either side).

  Email builder: add a Navigator (layers) panel to the left rail, mirroring the site builder's tree view; text blocks gain a `fontWeight` control and the color palette now exposes the full set of semantic roles (secondary/accent/neutral/info/success/warning/error), not just primary/base.

## 0.8.0

## 0.7.0

## 0.6.0

## 0.5.2

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- `ChatMessage` (the convenience wrapper, not the raw `Chat`/`ChatHeader`/`ChatFooter` primitives) now renders name/time _after_ the bubble instead of before it, matching a modern messaging-app read where the message is the point and the timestamp is a quiet trailing detail. The avatar's alignment flips from bottom- to top-anchored (`.chat-image` `align-self: start`) so it lines up with whatever's first in the group — the bubble in `ChatMessage`'s new order, or a `ChatHeader` name/time row for anyone composing the primitives directly (e.g. a Slack-style header-above layout) — instead of hanging toward a short trailing metadata line.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Fix several layout/visibility bugs found while auditing the playground, and add a proper chat typing indicator:

  - **Alert/Toast**: top-align the leading icon and trailing actions/close button (`align-items: flex-start`) instead of centering them against the whole (often multi-line) row. `.alert-close`/`.alert-actions`/`.toast-close` now claim their own trailing space via `margin-inline-start: auto` instead of relying on a sibling `AlertContent` to flex-grow — a dismissible one-liner Alert (bare children, no `AlertContent`) previously left the `×` sitting right next to the text instead of at the row's end.
  - **Collapsible**: new `CollapsibleTrigger` `variant="icon"` — a compact circular disclosure control (sized like `AlertClose`) for placing a second trigger in its own layout slot (e.g. an Alert's trailing actions) while a `variant="default"` trigger elsewhere carries the visible label; both share one `Collapsible`'s open state via context.
  - **Collapse**: renamed its CSS class from `.collapse` to `.details` everywhere (CSS, React, the `-html` macro, the prefix-recognition table, the builder's palette). Tailwind v4 ships a built-in `.collapse { visibility: collapse }` utility (for table row/column collapsing) that silently won over the component's own rule of the same name, making every `Collapse` invisible while it still occupied layout space. The public React names (`Collapse`/`CollapseTitle`/`CollapseContent`) are unchanged.
  - **Carousel**: `className` now applies to both the outer positioning root and the inner scroll strip, not just the strip. Previously a width-constraining class (e.g. `max-w-lg`) shrank the visible strip while the prev/next controls — absolutely positioned against the _root_ — stayed anchored to the full, unconstrained parent width.
  - **MockupPhone**: no component change; documented that content should fill the display (`w-full h-full`), not a fixed size smaller than it.
  - **Chat**: `.chat-layout-messages` now bottom-anchors (`justify-content: flex-end`) so a short conversation sits against the composer instead of pinned to the top with a dead gap below it. Added `ChatTypingIndicator` — three animated dots inside a real `.chat-bubble` (matching avatar/placement of a normal message) — replacing the old plain-text "is typing…" convention.

## 0.4.0

### Patch Changes

- 18da685: Fix `@wizeworks/silicaui-mcp`'s catalog generator so it can't silently drift out of sync again:

  - `behaviors.json` is now derived from `silicaui-behaviors`' real `HANDLERS` dispatch table instead of a hand-maintained file list — all 30 registered `BehaviorType`s are covered (previously only 11, missing `form` and every behavior added since).
  - `components.json` now also covers `silicaui-html`'s `ComponentDef` macro registry (208 framework-neutral components — Dialog, Popover, Combobox, etc.), not just `silicaui-react`. Each macro's real `BehaviorType`(s) are discovered by actually calling its `expand()`, not guessed. `get_component` now takes an optional `package` argument to disambiguate names that exist in both packages.
  - The generator now warns at `gen` time if a `silicaui-react` component's export has no matching row in the README's component table, instead of silently omitting it from the catalog forever.
  - `silicaui-react/README.md`'s component table gets 28 real components it was missing (`Timestamp`, `InputGroup`, `PasswordInput`, `MultiSelect`, `AppShell`, `PowerSearch`, the `DateInput`/`TimeInput` family, and others).
